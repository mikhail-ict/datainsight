Note:

There are now a large number of KSBs associated with this module. The learners may find it daunting (and perhaps boring) if the learner goes through them all right at the start of Day 1.

Alternatively, the tutor could mention KSBs a few at a time on a per-activity basis. If this method turns out to work best then we can delete these KSB intro slides in a future version of these slides.

## Common Types of Data File 📂
![](slides/image.png)<!-- .element: width="50%"-->

Note:

Learners will probably all have seen **CSV** and **XLSX** files before. **JSON** will be less familiar.

While all three file types were covered in the Online phase, extra recap may be required.

---

## CSV format
#### CSV: Comma-separated values
![](slides/image%202.png) <!-- .element: width="60%"-->

Note:

Key facts:
* **CSV** is a plaint-text format, suitable for storing unformatted numbers and text. (No font, colour, etc.)
* Since it is a text file, the CSV file contains no embedded metadata. (Unlike, e.g., a **JPEG**, **MP3** or **Microsoft Office** file.)
* The delimiter character is the comma.

---

## Knowledge Check 🧠
#### CSV: Comma-Separated Values

**Question 1.** What type of file is a **CSV** file?

* **A:** Image file 🖼️
* **B:** Plain-text file 📄
* **C:** Zip archive 📦
* **D:** Executable file ⚙️
* **E:** Excel file (same as XLSX) 📊

Note:

**Answer:** B – Plain-text file.

If any learners think the **CSV** format is the same as the **XLSX** format, it is probably worth pausing to recap the significant differences between the two.

## Knowledge Check 🧠
#### CSV: Comma-Separated Values

**Question 2.** What is the usual delimiter (separator) character in a **CSV** file?

* **A:** Tab `⠀⠀⠀`
* **B:** Colon `:`
* **C:** Space `⠀`
* **D:** Comma `,`
* **E:** Double-quote `”`
* **F:** Pipe `|`

Note:

**Answer:** D – Comma.

Answer at the top of the slide!

## Knowledge Check 🧠
#### CSV: Comma-Separated Values

**Question 3.** If we open a **CSV** file directly in **Excel**, what potentially unwanted transformations(s) could occur?

* **A:** Number **rounding**
* **B:** Date-like strings **converted to dates**
* **C:** Corrupted text due to **character encoding**, e.g., `Â£` instead of `£`
* **D:** **All of the above**

Note:

**Answer:** D – All of the above.

The tutor may wish to demonstrate by creating a CSV file in Notepad and showing that e.g. '5 jun' becomes 05/06/<current year>, and 000.12345678901234567890 becomes 0.123456789012345. This is data corruption!

(If anyone is interested: £ becomes Â£ due to differences between the UTF-8 and Windows-1252 character encodings. Rule of thumb: if we see odd symbols we didn’t expect, we should think 'character encoding mismatch'. At least one learner has failed EPA because of this problem.)

**Follow-up Q:** How can we open a CSV file in Excel with no danger of this kind of data corruption?

**Answer:** Power Query.

### Step 1: Open Notepad
1. Press `Windows + R`, type `notepad`, and press `Enter` (or open Notepad from the Start menu).

### Step 2: Create a CSV File
1. Type the following text exactly as shown (including quotes):

   ```
   "Date","Number"
   "5 jun","000.12345678901234567890"
   ```

2. Click **File > Save As**.
3. In the **Save as type** dropdown, select **All Files**.
4. In the **File name** box, type **data.csv** (ensure the extension is `.csv`).
5. Click **Save**.

### Step 3: Open the CSV File in Excel
1. Locate the saved `data.csv` file.
2. Double-click the file to open it in Microsoft Excel.

### Step 4: Observe the Data Corruption
1. Check the values displayed in Excel:
   - `"5 jun"` is likely converted to a date format such as **05/06/YYYY** (depending on regional settings).
   - `"000.12345678901234567890"` is displayed as **0.123456789012345** (losing precision beyond 15 digits).

### Step 5: Explain the Cause
1. **Automatic Date Formatting:** Excel assumes that "5 jun" is a date and automatically reformats it.
2. **Floating-Point Precision Limitation:** Excel only maintains up to 15 significant digits, truncating extra digits.

### Step 6: Discuss Solutions
To prevent this issue:
- Open CSV files **manually using "Get Data"** instead of double-clicking.
- Format columns **as text** before opening the file.
- Use an alternative program like **Notepad, Python, or a database** for data storage.

### 📌 Summary: What Does Power Query Solve?
| **Problem** | **Directly Opening CSV in Excel** | **Power Query Solution** |
|------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Automatic Date Formatting** | `"5 jun"` → `05/06/2025` | Keeps `"5 jun"` as text unless manually converted |
| **Loss of Precision** | `000.12345678901234567890` → `0.123456789012345` | Preserves full text version of number |
| **Character Encoding Issues** | `£` → `Â£` (incorrect) | Allows selecting correct encoding (UTF-8, Windows-1252, etc.) |
| **Leading Zeros Removal** | `"000123"` → `"123"` | Keeps `"000123"` intact as text |
| **Incorrect Delimiter Interpretation** | May split incorrectly | Lets you choose delimiter manually |

### ❓ Key Takeaway
Power Query doesn’t "fix" Excel’s fundamental limitations (like 15-digit number precision), but it **prevents Excel from automatically corrupting data during import** by giving you control over data types and encoding.

## XLSX format
#### XLSX: Open Office XML
![](slides/image%203.png) <!-- .element: width="70%"-->

Internally, an **XLSX** file is mostly a collection of **XML** files.

Note:

The screenshot to the right shows the internal structure of an **XLSX** file.

Key facts:
* **XLSX** is the native file format for **Microsoft Excel** workbooks. **Excel** can both read and write **XLSX**.
* **XLSX** supports many types of content, including spreadsheets, charts, formulas, rich formatting, Tables, Named Ranges, images, and more.

Bonus facts (not essential to teach):
* An **XLSX** file is a **zip archive** containing a collection of **XML** files in a folder structure. There may also be embedded image files.
* **XML** files are plain-text file. Like **JSON**, **XML** can encode nested data structures. **XML** is more versatile but also more complex to read and write.
* The tutor may wish to show an example of an **XML** file, but this is not essential. We will not be studying **XML** files in the apprenticeship.

## Excel Number Formats 🔢

![](slides/image%205.png) <!-- .element: width="50%"-->

Note:

### Live Demo: Number Formats in Excel
The tutor should provide a live demo introducing **Number Formats in Excel**. The learners should follow along.

#### Key Learning Points
- Various **Number Formats** are available in Excel, including **Currency, Date, and Scientific**.
- In Excel, **cell value and cell Number Format are independent of each other**. This is worth emphasising and explaining clearly, as many learners do not know this.
- In Excel, **dates and times are actually serial numbers** that count from **00/01/1900**. Learners should not worry if they see a number when they were expecting a date.
- With the default Number Format, **'General'**, Excel applies a reasonable format based on the cell contents.
- Excel can store a number to a precision of approximately **16 digits**, but no more. This has **ramifications on data analytics!**  
  *(What problems could occur? The tutor can invite ideas from learners.)*

#### Suggestions for Additional Teaching
- A reference guide to Number Formats is provided: **'Excel Custom Number Formats.xlsx'**.  
  *(This is old and a bit rough, but it’s OK as a take-home reference guide.)*
- Prove that **cell value and cell Number Format are truly independent**.
- Show that **Excel dates and times are really serial numbers**.  
  Learners should learn to recognise that **serial number 45,500 ≈ approximately present day**.

## Conditional Formatting 🎨

![](slides/image%206.png) <!-- .element: width="70%"-->

Note:

### Live Demo: Conditional Formatting in Excel  
The tutor should provide a live demo introducing **Conditional Formatting in Excel**. The learners should follow along.  

#### Key Learning Points  
- **Greater Than / Less Than / Equal To**  
- **Duplicate Values**  
- **Colour Scales, Bars, Icons**  
- **The Advantages of Conditional Formatting**  

#### For More Advanced Learners  
- **Custom Formula**  
  *(Warning: Not many learners are experienced enough in Excel for this.)*  
- **Format an Entire Table Row Based on the Value in a Single Column**  
  *(For advanced learners only.)*

## Excel Tables 📊
![](slides/image%207.png) <!-- .element: width="60%"-->
In **Excel,** the **Table** is a convenient container for structured data.

Tables offer many useful functions, including:
* **Sorting** and **filtering**.
* Excel formula integration. **Tables** and **Table** columns can be referenced by name.
* Dynamic referencing. Formula references to Table columns always point to the entire column, even when the Table changes size.

Note:

Depending on the experience of the learners, the tutor may wish to deliver a short intro to **Tables** in **Excel** prior to moving learners on to the 'Basic Filtering' activity, which involves filtering a Table.
